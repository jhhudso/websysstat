Websysstat gathers system statistics and presents them in graphs shown via a
web interface.

To compile: g++ -o websysstat -lhttpserver main.cpp

If you do not have libhttpserver.so already then run as:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./websysstat
Other run as:
./websysstat

Websysstat should be run from a directory with a htdocs sub-directory. The
htdocs sub-directory should contain all of the client-facing html, javascript
and images.
